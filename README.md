# HMS
In this project we have created a Hospital management system in which a patient can book his appointment with the doctor by 
just filling their few information and he will receive the confirmation mail also after their appoiment is confirmed

We use pywhatkit library to send the patient confirmation message on their whatsapp number.

We also use Mysql for doing CRUD operation on the data entered by the patients.

Others libraries used are: pandas, pywhatkit, Mysql, datetime, os, maskpass, tabulate, time and art.
